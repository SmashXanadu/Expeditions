# [The Emerald Dawn](#the-emerald-dawn)

The Emerald Dawn is a unique vessel grown from enchanted ironwood and reinforced with living coral. Green vines wrap around the masts, and the sails are woven from giant kelp that never dries out. She is a sturdy exploration vessel, built for long journeys and navigating treacherous seas, serving as a mobile sanctuary for our crew as we sail into uncharted waters.

### Associated Faction
The Verdant Circle

### Occupants

- **Captain Wren:** The stoic and experienced captain of the ship. Wren is a person of few words but keeps a keen eye on everything, guiding the ship's path with quiet authority.
- **Finn:** The ship's quartermaster and first mate. Finn is a resourceful and superstitious sailor who knows the ship inside and out, from the rigging to the provisions.
- **Pip:** The gentle and endlessly curious medic and botanist. Pip is responsible for keeping the crew healthy and is always on the lookout for new and interesting flora from the islands you visit.

-------
### Facilities

The Emerald Dawn has all the basic facilities necessary to keep a crew healthy and prepared for their expeditions. Because the ship is alive, the quarters are naturally climate-controlled by the ironwood hull, and the sickbay utilizes bioluminescent moss for lighting and specialized sea-salves for healing.
