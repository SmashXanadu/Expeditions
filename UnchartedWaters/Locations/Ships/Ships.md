# **The Verdant Wake**

Thick roots and vine-wrapped ribs reinforce the ship’s body, while its deck constantly beads with fresh water drawn from the air. The sails are woven from giant kelp-silk that flexes and breathes, catching wind and current alike. Wherever the Wake travels, fish gather in its shadow and the sea grows strangely calm—or violently opposed, depending on the Circle’s will.

---

### Facilities

Below deck, hollowed root-chambers store water, seeds, and medicinal growths rather than cargo. Living coral ballast adjusts the ship’s balance automatically, and bio-luminescent veins running through the hull provide soft light at night. Crew quarters are grown cocoons of bark and vine, warm, humid, and faintly humming with the ship’s pulse.
