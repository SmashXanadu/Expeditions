### Sunbloom Key

A tiny ring of sun-bleached stone barely rising above the waves, surrounded by a sprawling network of floating farm platforms tethered to the seabed. Ropes, chains, and living coral anchors hold hundreds of drifting garden-decks in loose formation, their green canopies forming a shimmering patchwork across the open water.

- **The Vibe:** Gentle, industrious, and improbably hopeful. The air smells of salt and fresh soil, and the quiet splash of irrigation buckets replaces the usual crash of waves.
- **The Hub:** **The Mooring Ring**, a circular dock-town built around the island’s single patch of solid ground. Here, storage silos, drying racks, and seed vaults cling to the rock, while rope-bridges and skiffs provide access to the drifting fields.
- **The Hook:** The farms rely on a delicate balance of tide, current, and carefully bred buoyant soil. A recent shift in the currents has begun dragging entire crop platforms out of alignment, threatening to scatter the fields across the sea—and with them, one of the only reliable food sources in the Uncharted Waters.

--------
### Occupants

- **Current-Farmers**: Skilled growers who tend crops from skiffs and narrow plankways, reading water movement like weather.
- **Tidewrights**: Engineers and coral-shapers who maintain the anchor systems and buoyant frameworks.
- **Seed-Keepers**: Careful archivists who guard rare plant strains engineered to thrive on salt spray and shifting platforms.

--------
### Facilities

- **Floating Field Lattices**: Vast grids of tethered farming decks growing grains, fruit, and medicinal plants.
- **Buoyancy Forges**: Workshops dedicated to crafting sealed pontoons, living floats, and coral anchors.
- **Driftstore Vaults**: Climate-stabilized seed and crop storage chambers carved directly into the island’s stone.
