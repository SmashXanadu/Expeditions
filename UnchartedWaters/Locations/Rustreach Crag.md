### Rustreach Crag

A steep, jagged rock juts from the sea like a broken tooth, its sheer face riddled with vertical mine shafts plunging deep into the lightless belly of the stone. The settlement clings to the exterior in a precarious lattice of industrial balconies, heavy-duty cranes, and hanging walkways, all devoted to dragging precious ore up from the depths.

- **The Vibe:** Industrial, vertical, and metallic. The air reeks of sulfur and wet stone, filled with the relentless clack-clack-clack of ore buckets rattling along iron rails. Everything is stained with orange rust and green copper oxidation.
- **The Hub:** **The Winch-Works**, a massive open-air platform bolted halfway up the Fang. This serves as the town square where the primary elevators converge. It houses the smelting furnaces, the Overseer’s office, and the *Bucket & Tankard*—a tavern where miners drink grit from their throats while watching the sun sink past the endless vertical drop.
- **The Hook:** Verdigris Fang is a geological anomaly. The deeper the shafts go, the more the rock seems to *bleed* warm salt water, flooding tunnels faster than they can be reinforced. Rumors claim the lowest levels have breached a cavern of **Living Copper**, pulsing like a heart and drawing strange, metallic-shelled creatures up from the surrounding depths.

### Occupants

- **Shaft Miners**: Hardened workers who spend most of their lives suspended over open drops, trusting chains more than people.
- **The Overseer**: A company-appointed authority who controls access to the deepest shafts and rations lift time.
- **Flood-Runners**: Desperate crews tasked with sealing breaches and pumping water, often racing against rising tides underground.

### Facilities

- **Primary Lift Shafts**: Enormous bucket elevators running the full height of the Fang, powered by steam and counterweights.
- **Smelt Platforms**: Open furnaces built directly into the cliff face, venting heat and fumes out over the sea.
- **Pump Galleries**: Constantly expanding networks of pipes and pressure doors meant to hold back the encroaching floodwaters.
