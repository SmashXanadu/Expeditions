### Weirwild Atoll

A massive, ancient forest growing directly out of a shallow reef, its colossal roots knotted together above and below the waterline. There is no solid ground here; the entire atoll is a living lattice of roots, shadowed pools, and glowing growths beneath a dense canopy.

- **The Vibe:** Primal, claustrophobic, and bioluminescent.
- **The Hub:** **High Weir**, a village suspended in the upper branches where massive platforms are lashed to living limbs. Travel is done by small canoes through the submerged root-tunnels at low tide or by leaping across moss-slick bridges and platforms above.
- **The Hook:** The tides here are extreme. When the waters recede, they reveal lightless caverns, ancient ruins, and shipwrecks tangled in roots for centuries. When the tide rises, the lower village is swallowed whole, forcing all life upward into the canopy.

--------
### Occupants

- **Canopy Wardens**: Agile climbers and hunters who maintain the ropeways, bridges, and platforms of High Weir.
- **Root-Speakers**: Mystics who claim to commune with the forest itself, interpreting its bioluminescent pulses as warnings or omens.
- **Driftbound Survivors**: Sailors whose ships were claimed by the atoll and who now live among the branches, unable or unwilling to leave.

---------------
### Facilities

- **High Weir Platforms**: Interconnected living decks grown and reinforced over generations, forming the heart of the settlement.
- **Root-Tunnel Docks**: Narrow canoe passages used only at low tide, mapped by memory rather than charts.
- **Glow Groves**: Carefully tended clusters of bioluminescent plants and fungi that provide light after sunset.
