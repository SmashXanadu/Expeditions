### Ashfall Peak

A volcanic island with black sand beaches and a vast, slumbering volcano at its heart. Fertile ash-soil jungles blanket the lower slopes, while higher elevations give way to jagged ridges, obsidian flows, and wind-scoured stone.

- **The Vibe:** Tropical, fertile, and adventurous.
- **The Hub:** **Emberside**, a collection of longhouses built on stilts above the black sands. The locals harness geothermal vents for smithing, cooking, and heating. It feels like a hard-edged frontier outpost—the last reliable haven before the maps go blank.
- **The Hook:** Beneath the island lies a honeycomb of obsidian lava tubes formed by ancient flows. These tunnels create a sprawling natural dungeon directly under the settlement, rumored to contain rare gemstones, heat-resistant flora, and things that never fully cooled.

---------
### Occupants

- **Vent-Smiths**: Skilled artisans who work metal using geothermal heat, producing blades and tools prized across the sea.
- **Ashwalkers**: Jungle guides and hunters adapted to the island’s shifting terrain and toxic fumes.
- **Emberside Settlers**: A mix of explorers, exiles, and traders drawn by opportunity and the island’s untapped wealth.

-------------
### Facilities

- **Geothermal Forges**: Open-air smithies built around natural vents, their glow visible even at night.
- **Ashfall Docks**: Reinforced piers driven deep into volcanic sand, designed to survive tremors and shifting tides.
- **Lava Tube Entrances**: Marked (and unmarked) access points into the obsidian tunnels, some maintained, others sealed or forgotten.
