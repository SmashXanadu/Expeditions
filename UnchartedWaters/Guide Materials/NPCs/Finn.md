### **Finn**
![Finn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmashXanadu/Expeditions/refs/heads/main/images/finn.png)

**Ship Role:** Quartermaster

**General Appearance:** Finn is lean and wiry, with nimble fingers always busy with a knot or a loose thread on their worn but well-maintained clothing. Their hair is a tangled mess of sun-bleached brown, often escaping from under a perpetually askew bandana. They have bright, curious eyes that flicker nervously at distant storm clouds.

**Sounds Like:** Their voice is a rapid-fire cadence, shifting between boisterous laughter and hushed, conspiratorial whispers. Finn speaks with a thick, rolling accent that feels as old as the sea itself, and they frequently interject with nautical phrases and proverbs.

**Defining Characteristic(s):** Finn is defined by their boundless energy and an almost uncanny ability to "find" thingsâ€”be it a missing tool, a forgotten snack, or a peculiar trinket washed ashore. They are also notoriously superstitious, attributing nearly every event, good or bad, to mystical signs.

**Motivation:** Finn believes deeply in a dormant, ancient sea spirit that slumbers beneath the uncharted waters. They are convinced that the "Expeditions" are part of a grand design to awaken or appease this entity. Finn secretly collects bizarre artifacts and samples from each new land, viewing them as sacred offerings or vital clues to fulfilling a prophecy, often subtly nudging the ship's course towards areas they deem "blessed" or "cursed."

**Flaw or Quirk:** Finn has an intense fear of calm seas, believing prolonged stillness is an omen of ill fortune. They also have a habit of muttering to themselves, particularly when handling strange objects or staring out at the open water.
