### **Captain Wren**

![Wren](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmashXanadu/Expeditions/refs/heads/main/images/wren.png)

**Ship Role:** Captain

**General Appearance:** Wren has a weathered face with deep-set eyes that seem to miss nothing. Their dark hair is pulled back in a tight bun, and they carry themselves with a straight, unyielding posture. They are typically dressed in a clean but well-worn captain's coat, often seen with a simple brass spyglass in hand.

**Sounds Like:** Their voice is low and measured. Wren speaks slowly and deliberately, choosing their words carefully. They have a subtle accent from a far-off port that is hard to place.

**Defining Characteristic(s):** Wren is defined by a quiet, unwavering authority. They don't need to shout to be in command; a single look is often enough. They are intensely observant and seem to be thinking several steps ahead of everyone else.

**Motivation:** Wren is on a personal quest to find a legendary, lost star chart known as the "Celestial Navigator." This chart is the key to fulfilling a vow made long ago to a lost loved one. This goal is more important to them than the faction's interests, and they will take calculated risks to find it, even if it means putting the ship in harm's way.

**Flaw or Quirk:** Wren has a habit of silently tracing the constellations on any available surface—a tabletop, a map, or even the palm of their hand—when deep in thought. They also have an intense aversion to clutter and will often pause a conversation to straighten something that is out of place.
