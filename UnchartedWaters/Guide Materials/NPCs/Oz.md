### **Oz**

![Oz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmashXanadu/Expeditions/refs/heads/main/images/oz.png)

**Ship Role:** Waystone Magus / Archivist

**General Appearance:** Oz appears as an ageless figure of indeterminate gender, with smooth, almost porcelain-like skin and silver-white hair that seems to float around their head. Their eyes are a striking, deep blue, like polished lapis lazuli. They wear robes woven with shimmering, geometric patterns that subtly shift and glow. Their movements are graceful and precise.

**Sounds Like:** Their voice is calm and melodious, with a faint, echoing quality, as if speaking from a great distance. They speak in a measured, slightly formal tone and often use very specific, academic language to describe magical phenomena.

**Defining Characteristic(s):** Oz is entirely preoccupied with the **Waystones** and the magical anchor of The Emerald Dawn. They are the one who maintains the ship's magical systems and provides the stones for each expedition. They seem to view the world through a lens of magical equations and patterns, often talking to the Waystones themselves as if they were sentient.

**Motivation:** Oz is not driven by the faction's goals, but by a consuming desire to understand and perfect the magical architecture of the world. They believe the Waystones and The Emerald Dawn are part of a larger, ancient network of magical ley lines. Their goal is to map this network and, in doing so, unlock a new form of instantaneous travel that could span across the entire world, not just back to the ship.

**Flaw or Quirk:** Oz is highly detached from the practical, emotional concerns of the crew. They see people and their problems as variables in a larger magical equation. They also have a habit of meticulously cataloging and sketching every single **Waystone** and its unique energy signature, believing no two are ever truly alike.
