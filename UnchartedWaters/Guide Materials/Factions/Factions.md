### **The Verdant Circle**
*Druids*
The Circle is a collective of guardians who view the ocean as a single living organism that must be protected from exploitation. They travel in organic vessels, using spirit-magic to command the sea life and currents to repel those who would pollute the deep.

- **Ship:** The Verdant Wake – A unique vessel grown from enchanted ironwood and reinforced with living coral. Green vines wrap around the masts, and the sails are woven from giant kelp that never dries out.
- **Leader:** Arch-Druid Thalassa, a figure whose skin has begun to take on the texture of polished driftwood.
- **Location:** **Weirwild Atoll** – The Circle resides within this massive living lattice of roots and glowing growths. They tend to the shadowed pools and ensure the dense canopy remains a sanctuary for the world's oldest sea-spirits.
- **Motivation:** To restore the balance of the ocean by purging "dead-water" (pollution) and protecting endangered leviathans.
- **Hook:** The The Verdant Wake has been seen blockading a major trade route, claiming the migration of the Great Whales takes precedence over  commerce.

### **The Iron Legion**
*Mercenaries*
A highly disciplined military corporation, the Iron Legion provide elite protection and naval enforcement for whoever has the coin to pay. They operate out of fortified sea-bastions, maintaining a fleet of heavy warships that prioritize tactical superiority and overwhelming firepower.

- **Ship:** _Crimson Tide_ – A heavily armored war-galley with a hull painted a deep, intimidating red. It features a reinforced ram and multiple decks of heavy ballistae.
- **Leader:** Commander Valerius, a scarred veteran who treats naval warfare like a game of chess.
- **Location:** **Ashfall Peak** – The Legion uses the jagged ridges and obsidian flows as a natural fortress. They have established high-elevation watchtowers on the wind-scoured stone to monitor the surrounding horizon for miles.
- **Motivation:** To fulfill contracts with absolute efficiency, ensuring that the highest bidder maintains control over the waves.
- **Hook:** The _Crimson Tide_ is currently under contract to hunt down a legendary sea monster, but they are looking for "disposable" scouts to lure it to the surface.

### **The Deep Crawlers**
*Deep Sea Scavengers*
The Crawlers view the ocean floor as a vast, unplundered museum. They are the primary source of ancient technology and "Old World" metals, often sporting scars, pressure-burns, and mechanical augmentations from their dangerous work in the lightless trenches.

- **Ship:** _Azure Abyss_ – A low-profile, sturdy vessel equipped with massive cranes, winches, and primitive diving bells. Its hull is reinforced to withstand the pressure of the deepest trenches.
- **Leader:** Foreman Grogori, a man who spends more time in a brass diving suit than out of it.
- **Location:** **Rustreach Crag** – While the miners work the upper shafts, the Deep Crawlers control the "Abyssal Cradle" at the base of the Crag. They utilize the steep, submerged cliffs as a vertical highway, launching their bells and tethered explorers into the lightless belly of the stone where the ocean floor meets the foundations of the world.
- **Motivation:** To recover "Old World" technology and artifacts buried on the seafloor before they are lost to the silt forever.
- **Hook:** A diver on the _Azure Abyss_ found a sealed vault but went mad shortly after; the crew needs someone to enter the vault and retrieve the contents.

### **The Gilded Union**
*Traders*
The Gilded Union is a massive, bureaucratic network of trade lords who control the flow of all essential resources across the globe. They believe that gold is the only true law, using their immense wealth to influence politics and maintain a monopoly on the most profitable shipping lanes.

- **Ship:** _Golden Sovereign_ – A massive, four-masted treasure galleon with gold-leaf detailing and silk sails. It is more of a floating palace than a mere cargo ship.
- **Leader:** High Factor Aurelia, a woman who values a silver tongue as much as a sharp sword.
- **Location:** **Driftbloom Key** – The Union manages the sprawling network of floating farm platforms. They control the garden-decks and the "living coral anchors," effectively owning the largest food-production hub in the open ocean.
- **Motivation:** To monopolize the trade of rare spices, fresh water, and luxury goods across all known territories.
- **Hook:** The _Golden Sovereign_ has been "taxed" by a phantom ship that leaves no survivors, and Aurelia is hiring investigators to track the ghost-vessel.

### **The Black Fleet**
*Pirates*

- **Ship:** _Black Talon_ – A sleek, black-sailed schooner built for extreme speed. It sits low in the water, making it nearly invisible at night or in heavy fog.
- **Leader:** Captain Vane the Shadow, a pirate known for boarding ships without firing a single cannon.
- **Location:** **The Driftworks** – The Fleet often hides their vessels within this colossal armada. The ever-shifting nature of the ships lashed together makes it the perfect place for a pirate to vanish or fence stolen goods.
- **Motivation:** To dismantle the Gilded Union’s grip on the ocean and live truly free of any law or king.
- **Hook:** The _Black Talon_ has captured a royal envoy, and the party is hired to either rescue the envoy or negotiate a ransom before the "Talon" disappears.

### **The Arcane Circle**
*Mages*
The Circle is an elitist society of scholars and mystics who draw their power from the celestial bodies and the pull of the tides. They remain largely reclusive, emerging from their crystalline observatories only to intervene when the cosmic balance of the world is threatened.
- **Ship:** _Silver Crescent_ – An elegant, slender ship made of white marble and silvered timber. It leaves a glowing wake of moonlight behind it, and its sails seem to catch wind even when none exists.
- **Leader:** High Oracle Selene, a blind seer who navigates purely by the pull of the tides.
- **Location:** **The Siren’s Rest** – The Mages are the keepers of the pink-marbled ruins. They study the melodic resonance of the island and are the only ones who truly understand how to maintain the "Peace-Bond" enchantment.
- **Motivation:** To study the celestial alignments and harness the power of the moon to control the world’s tides and currents.
- **Hook:** The moon has turned blood-red, and the _Silver Crescent_ is desperately seeking ancient star charts that are said to be held in a pirate-controlled archive.

### **The Horizon Chasers**
*Explorers*
The Horizon Chasers are a daring fellowship of voyagers who believe the ocean has no end, only "undiscovered beginnings." They are the pioneers of the deep blue, obsessed with documenting shifting currents, hidden archipelagos, and the celestial movements that guide them through the trackless wastes.

- **Ship:** _The Cobalt Needle_ – A small, nimble vessel filled with telescopes, drafting tables, and strange measuring instruments. It is built for endurance and long-range scouting.
- **Leader:** Chief Cartographer Elara, obsessed with filling the "blank spots" on the world map.
- **Location:** **The Driftworks** – Unlike the pirates, the Seekers use the Driftworks as a mobile headquarters. Since the armada travels the open sea, it allows the Seekers to start their mapping expeditions from a different coordinate every month.
- **Motivation:** To document every island, reef, and current in the world to ensure safe passage for all.
- **Hook:** Elara has found evidence of a "Hidden Continent" but needs a crew to venture beyond the mapped world to prove it exists.

### The Copper Coalition
*Miners*
The Coalition is an industrial powerhouse stationed atop volatile volcanic vents, extracting the raw materials that fuel the world's navies. They live in a constant state of heat and smoke, driven by a brutal work ethic to produce the strongest alloys found anywhere on the waves.

- **Ship:** _The Ember_ – A steam-belching, iron-clad vessel used to transport raw ore and molten metals. It is constantly hot to the touch and smells of sulfur and coal.
- **Leader:** Overseer Bram, a soot-covered dwarf-equivalent who cares more about quotas than safety.
- **Location:** **Rustreach Crag** – The Coalition owns the vertical mine shafts of the Crag. Their industrial balconies and steam-powered cranes dominate the jagged rock's face, turning the "broken tooth" of stone into a vertical factory.
- **Motivation:** To provide the metal and fuel necessary for the other factions to build their ships and weapons.
- **Hook:** A volcanic vent has begun erupting uncontrollably, threatening to sink the mining colony; the _Copper Ember_ needs brave souls to go down and stabilize the pressure.
