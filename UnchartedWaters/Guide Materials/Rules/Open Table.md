### Open Table
The "Open Table" style of play is a more flexible way of running the game than a traditional campaign with a set number of players locked in for a series of sessions. The basic concept is that a pool of characters will be going on expeditions in a persistent world, but which players and which characters show up will not dictate if we can play.

**We play if we have 2-5 players**. As long as we have at least 2 players willing to play we will play. We will cap out at a maximum of 5 players per session. This can be any combination of players or characters, returning or new.

**We play every week**. Unless there is an emergency or we do not meet minimum attendance (2 players), we will be playing Uncharted Waters every week on day at Xpm for Y hours.
### Discord
**The Bitter Badger** is where we will communicate and coordinate between sessions. This is managed by Will, please reach out if you need an invite.

If you would like to be a member of our Open Table, you will be given access to two channels:
1. **player-chat**: General discussion for open table players. Out of character.
2. **the-emerald-dawn**: In character discussions of in-game and downtime activity. Sit back, have a drink, and share tales of your adventures

Open Table events will be posted in discord with 2-5 available spots per week.
