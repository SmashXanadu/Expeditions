### Open Table
**We play if we have 2-5 players**. As long as we have at least 2 players willing to play we will play. We will cap out at a maximum of 5 players per session. This can be any combination of players or characters, returning or new.

**We play every week**. Unless there is an emergency or we do not meet minimum attendance, we will be playing Uncharted Waters every week on day at pm for hours.

### Discord
Events - Sign ups, Waitlist, priority, etc.
