### How to Catalogue Discoveries

When you return from an expedition, you can submit your findings to the Catalogue. Your **Guide** will determine the quality of your submission based on the details you provide.

Here’s what you can catalogue:

- **Locations:** Detailed maps, geographical descriptions, and sketches of newly discovered islands, ruins, or landmarks.
- **Monsters:** Observations on a creature's appearance, behaviors, strengths, weaknesses, and habitat.
- **Humanoid Species:** Information on their culture, language, society, and history.
- **Flora & Fauna:** Samples or descriptions of unique plants, animals, and herbs found in the wild.
- **Materials:** Samples of new ores, magical reagents, or unique crafting materials.
- **Magical Artifacts:** Descriptions of artifacts, their properties, and their potential uses.

Your submission to the Catalogue can be as simple as a detailed description or as complex as a collected physical sample, a drawn map, or a captured creature.
