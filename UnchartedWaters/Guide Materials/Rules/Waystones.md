### Waystones

A **Waystone** is a smooth, palm-sized crystal that hums with a faint, steady light. This stone is magically linked to a specific location, serving as a beacon. When a Waystone is "anchored" to a location, it creates a magical tether that allows the crew to return at any time. This tether is also the key to the game's time limit, as the stone will forcefully recall anyone linked to it when its magic expires.

### How They Work
Players in **Uncharted Waters** start with a single **waystone** that is anchored to the **Emerald Dawn**.

#### Voluntary Return

If players wishes to end an expedition early, they can perform a quick ritual to return to the ship. All players must **touch the Waystone** while holding hands for **30 seconds**. As the ritual concludes, a powerful flash of light envelops the party, and a chaotic rush of energy pulls them back to The Emerald Dawn.

#### The Waystone's Call

When the expedition timer runs out, the magic tether between The Emerald Dawn and the Waystone snaps. Instead of a controlled return, players are pulled back to the ship in a single, disorienting surge. The Waystone's magic forcefully yanks each adventurer back to the safety of the ship, whether they are ready or not.
