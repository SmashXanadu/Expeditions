# [Uncharted Waters - Start Here](#StartHere)

Ready for adventure? **Uncharted Waters** is an ongoing, open-table campaign using the **Expeditions** ruleset. This means you can drop in and out as your schedule allows, playing with a rotating cast of fellow adventurers in a living, breathing world. Get ready to explore, fight, and tell amazing stories together!

In **Uncharted Waters**, you'll embark on a grand adventure aboard **[The Emerald Dawn]({{site.baseurl}}/UnchartedWaters/Gazetteer/#emeraldDawn)**, your trusty ship, as you sail ever westward into lands unknown. Every expedition brings you closer to discovering bizarre new islands, encountering strange creatures, and unraveling ancient secrets that lie hidden beyond the known world.

Each session of Expeditions is a new foray into this vast, uncharted frontier. Will you discover a floating city, brave a storm-tossed archipelago, or unearth a relic from a forgotten civilization? The possibilities are as endless as the ocean itself, and your courage will chart the course.
## What to expect as a Player
Hereâ€™s what you can look forward to when you join an **Expeditions** session in **Uncharted Waters**:
- **Weekly Adventures:** We play **every week** on **[Day] at [X PM] for [Y hours]**. We only skip if there's an emergency or fewer than two players sign up.
- **Evolving Rules:** The game system is a design in progress, and we're always refining it. Your feedback can help shape the future of Expeditions!
- **Flexible Play Style:** Each session offers a blend of thrilling combat, engaging social interactions, and exciting exploration. The focus is on collaborative storytelling and having a great time.

## What the Other Players Expect from You
Being part of an open table is a shared experience. Here's how you can help make every session awesome for everyone:
- **Sign Up:** Keep an eye on Discord for weekly game events. If you want to play, grab an open spot (2-5 players per session) so we know who's coming!
- **Bring a Character:** You can use a character you've already made or come with an idea and create a new one for your first session. Don't worry, character creation is quick and easy, and we can help you get started.
- **Be Present:** Put away distractions and immerse yourself in the adventure. Your focus helps keep the story moving and makes the experience better for everyone.
- **Be Inclusive:** We're a friendly group! Welcome new players, listen to everyone's ideas, and contribute to a positive and respectful environment at the table.

## How "Open Table" Works
"Open Table" means flexibility! Instead of a fixed group, a pool of characters can go on expeditions in a persistent world. The campaign continues regardless of which specific players or characters are present.
- **Always Playable:** As long as we have 2 to 5 players signed up, we play! This can be any mix of returning or new players and characters.
- **Persistent World:** Even if your character isn't in a session, the world keeps moving. You'll hear tales of what happened from other players.

## Our Discord Community
All our communication and coordination happen on Discord. **[Will]** manages the server, so reach out if you need an invite!

Once you're a member of our Open Table, you'll get access to two key channels:
1. **#player-chat:** This is our general discussion area for players. Think of it as our out-of-character lounge.
2. **#the-emerald-dawn:** This channel is for in-character discussions and downtime activities. It's a great place to chat, share stories of your adventures, and roleplay between sessions.
