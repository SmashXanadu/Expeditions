## Clear the Docks

**Difficulty:** ★☆☆☆☆
**Duration:** 1 Hour

**My grain stores are being overrun** by things that are much larger and meaner than your average sewer rat. **It’s a filthy job in the dark**, and I need it done before my inventory is nothing but droppings. Stop by the warehouse afterward for a hot meal and some sturdy supplies I've pulled from the crates.

## A Subtle Swap

**Difficulty:** ★★☆☆☆
**Duration:** 1 Hour

**I require a specialist** to attend a specific event and ensure a certain document is "misplaced" in favor of my own. **Keep your weapons hidden** and your ears open; if you can do this without causing a scene, I’ll grant you access to my private collection of gear and official seals.

## Escort Through the Fog

**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆
**Duration:** 2 Hours

**I must reach the center of the Shifting Woods** before the lunar eclipse ends, but I am no fighter. **Guide my path and keep the beasts at bay** while I gather what I need from the clearing. Do this for me, and I’ll ensure you leave my workshop with a selection of my finest tinctures and a rare trinket for your trouble.

## Lost to the Deep

**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆
**Duration:** 2 Hours

**My research vessel was pulled under** by a sudden current near the Sapphire Cove, and my charts are now sitting at the bottom of the bay. **I need a diver or a dreamer** to go down and pull my satchel from the wreckage before the tide scatters it. Help me finish my life's work, and I'll share the curios and strange artifacts I’ve pulled from the sea floor.

## The Dead Don't Rest

**Difficulty:** ★★★★☆
**Duration:** 2 Hours

**The catacombs are weeping.** Something has stirred the spirits in the Sunken Crypts, and they are clawing at the gates. **Go down into the rot** and find whatever is waking them up. If you return, the Temple will see you rewarded with blessed relics and secrets from our vault that have not seen the sun in a century.

## The Shattered Spire

**Difficulty:** ★★★★☆
**Duration:** 3 Hours

**I need someone with iron nerves** to scale the ruins of the Sky-Reaching Spire and bring back a fragment of the fallen star I saw strike the peak. **The climb will break you** if the stone guardians don't get to you first, but I have a heavy chest of heirloom jewelry and a pouch of coin for whoever brings me my prize.

## Silence the Howling

**Difficulty:** ★★★★★
**Duration:** 3 Hours

**A beast is stalking our livestock** and my hunters haven't returned from the high passes. **Track this monster down** and bring me proof of its end so my people can sleep again. We don't have much gold, but we will part with our most sacred ancestral weapon and a share of the winter's silver to see it dead.

## The Obsidian Heart

**Difficulty:** ★★★★★ **Duration:** 3 Hours

**The volcano is waking up**, and it isn’t natural; someone has placed a ritual seal on the inner caldera to force an eruption. **I need a team to descend into the heat** and break the obsidian spikes before this whole valley is buried in ash. If you save my home, you may take any of the rare ores or enchanted metals we've stored in the mountain vaults.
