We will be using the D&D Fifth Edition ruleset contained in the [5.1 CC SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/dnd/SRD_CC_v5.1.pdf) and [5eSRD](https://www.5esrd.com/) tools to easily access the SRD contents.

We will be using the following rules alterations for our Open Table to ensure we use our limited time sessions as efficiently as possible.

### Team Initiative
At the start of combat, determine if the player characters or the enemies have initiated combat. Whichever team initiated combat takes turns taking actions until their *entire team* has taken a turn, then the opposing team does the same. Combat continues alternating between player character turns and enemy turns. 

### Round Robin Initiative
When rolling for initiative at the start of combat, the highest player character initiative goes first when the team takes their turn. After this first player, we go clockwise around the table until every player character has taken a turn.

### Static Monster Damage
Monsters will have a set amount of damage they do when each of their attacks succeeds and the GM will not roll monster damage.
