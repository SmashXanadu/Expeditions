| **Crushing Weight** |
| *You intensify the pull of gravity around a foe, pinning them down and making their armor feel like lead.* |
| |
| **Type**: Magic \| **Node**: Gravity \| **Charges**: 2 |
| |
| You can increase the gravitational force around a target, making it difficult for them to move and crushing their defenses. Do one of the following:<br>1. Make a Magic attack against an enemy in Near range. On success, they take a damage and are immobile until your next turn.<br>2. Increase the gravitational force in a Near zone, making all enemies unable to move until your next turn. |

| **Levitate** |
| *You negate local gravity, allowing a target to drift helplessly upward or granting yourself a momentary boost.* |
| |
| **Type**: Magic \| **Node**: Gravity \| **Charges**: 2 |
| |
| You can manipulate gravity to lift yourself and others into the air. Do one of the following:<br>1. Make a Magic attack against an enemy in Near range. On success, they are lifted off the ground until your next turn. All attacks against them gain Advantage.<br>2. Lift yourself off the ground, allowing you to safely launch yourself up to 2 zones away. |

| **Kinetic Tether** |
| *You weave invisible lines of force between objects, either violently slamming them together or rigidly locking them in place.* |
| |
| **Type**: Magic \| **Node**: Gravity \| **Charges**: 3 |
| |
| You can manipulate gravity to create a connection between two objects, pulling them together or holding them apart. Do one of the following:<br>1. Make a Magic attack against an enemy in Near range. On success, they take a damage and are pulled towards you.<br>2. Create a tether between two objects in Near range, preventing them from moving away from each other. |

| **Disintegration Beam** |
| *You project a focused field of extreme gravitational collapse, tearing matter apart at the atomic level.* |
| |
| **Type**: Magic \| **Node**: Gravity \| **Charges**: 1 |
| |
| You can create a field of intense gravity that disrupts the molecular structure of matter, causing it to break apart.<br>Target an enemy in Near range with a Magic Attack. On success, they take double damage. On critical success, they are completely disintegrated. |
