## [Attack](#Attack)

The **Attack** skill determines your proficiency when dealing physical damage, typically through weapons or certain martial abilities.

Your ability to initiate an attack comes in two forms:

- **Using Abilities:** When you activate an **Ability** unlocked via a **Hero Grid Node**, you will use either your **Attack** or your **Magic** skill, as specifically indicated by that Ability's description.
    
- **Basic Attack:** You may always perform a simple, basic attack using any **equipped weapon**. This action uses your **Attack** skill.
  
Unless otherwise stated, all attacks deal 1 damage.
