## [Magic](#Magic)

The **Magic** skill determines your proficiency when dealing magical damage, typically through specific magical abilities.

Your ability to initiate an a magical attack comes in two forms:

- **Using Abilities:** When you activate an **Ability** unlocked via a **Hero Grid Node**, you will use either your **Attack** or your **Magic** skill, as specifically indicated by that Ability's description.
    
- **Basic Attack:** You may always perform a simple, basic magic attack by describing a more simplified manifestation of a type of **magic ability** that you know. This action uses your **Magic** skill.
  
Unless otherwise stated, all magical attacks deal 1 damage.
