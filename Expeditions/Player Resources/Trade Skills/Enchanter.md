## [Enchanter](#Enchanter)
Imbue people and equipment with magical properties.

**Example Actions:**
- Removing or countering magical enchantments.

**Downtime Actions**:
- **Item Enchanting**: Adding magical effects to weapons and armor.
- **Personal Enchantment**: Enhancing personal abilities with magic.
- **Rune Inscription**: Applying magical runes to objects.

**Skill Perks:**
- ☐ **Lasting Affixation:** You can create enchantments with extended durations. Magic you imbue on items or people lasts significantly longer than typical enchantments of similar power. 
  
- ☐ **Elemental Weaving:** You can infuse objects with elemental energies. Weapons you enchant can deal additional elemental damage (choose one element), and armor can grant minor resistance to a chosen element.
  
- ☐ **Synergistic Runes:** You can inscribe runes that interact with each other or existing magical properties. You can create combinations of runes that grant enhanced or unique effects when used together.
  
- ☐ **Self Enhancement:** You can permanently enhance your personal abilities with magic. You can grant a small, permanent bonus to a skill check or saving throw of your choice to yourself.
