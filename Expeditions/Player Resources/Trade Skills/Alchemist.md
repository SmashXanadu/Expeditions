Mix potions and salves with magical properties.

**Example Actions:**
- Recognizing rare magical components.
  
**Downtime Actions**:
- **Potion Brewing**: Creating magical potions with specific effects.
- **Experimental Concoctions**: Inventing new and unique alchemical formulas.

**Skill Perks:**
- ☐ **Enhanced Reactions:** Your understanding of alchemical processes allows for more potent concoctions. When brewing a potion, you can choose to enhance one of its effects, increasing its duration, potency, or range.
  
- ☐ **Stable Infusions:** You can create alchemical substances with lasting effects. When brewing a potion, you can choose to make its effects permanent on a single target or imbue an object with a lasting magical property. Only one permanent effect may persist on each effected player.
  
- ☐ **Swift Brew:** In urgent situations, you can rapidly prepare alchemical remedies. Once per expedition you can brew a basic healing potion or a simple antidote in a significantly reduced amount of time.
  
- ☐ **Unstable Mutations:** You experiment with volatile ingredients to create transformative concoctions. You can brew potions with unpredictable effects that can alter a creature's physical abilities or grant them temporary, unusual traits with potential drawbacks determined by the Guide.
