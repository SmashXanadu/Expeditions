# Finrik
Finrik, a wise and gentle shapeshifter, carries the weight of ancient knowledge and a deep connection to the natural world. Driven by a desire to protect the delicate balance of the wild and guide those lost in its depths, they have a habit of collecting rare flora and fauna specimens, meticulously documenting their findings in a worn journal. With their warped wooden staff and innate magical abilities, Finrik seamlessly shifts between animal, aquatic, and flying forms, adapting to any environment and leading their companions with unwavering kindness.
