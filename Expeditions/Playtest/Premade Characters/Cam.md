# Cam
Cam, a nimble scout with an insatiable curiosity for the unknown, roams the wilds with an almost unsettlingly keen eye for detail. Driven by a desire to map every hidden path and uncover every lost secret, they often speak in riddles and have a habit of collecting odd trinkets and animal bones. With a short bow in hand, Cam utilizes their speed and sharp observation to exploit enemy weaknesses and provide crucial covering fire for their allies.
