# Brigg
## About
Brigg, a hulking blacksmith turned warrior, carries the weight of his abandoned forge and a deep-seated guilt for failing to protect his village. His large frame and booming voice, though often used to intimidate, mask a surprising gentleness and a persistent habit of polishing anything metallic he can get his hands on. Driven by a desire for redemption and to ensure no one suffers as his people did, he wields his massive battle axe with brutal efficiency, cleaving through foes with wide, sweeping arcs.
