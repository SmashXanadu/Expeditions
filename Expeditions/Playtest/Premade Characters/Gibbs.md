# Gibbs
Gibbs, a quick and cunning rogue with a penchant for elaborate pranks and a nervous habit of fiddling with small objects, slips through shadows with unnerving ease. Driven by a desire to escape their troubled past and amass a fortune, they rely on their nimble fingers and sharp wit to outmaneuver opponents and manipulate situations to their advantage. With a dagger in hand and a satchel of alchemical concoctions, Gibbs excels at swift strikes and calculated escapes, leaving a trail of bewildered victims in their wake.
