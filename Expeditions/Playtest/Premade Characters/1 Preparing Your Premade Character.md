# Preparing Your Character: A Step-by-Step Guide

## 1. Transfer Basic Character Info

* Write down the starting values for **Health**, **Size**, **Speed**, and **Gold**.

## 2. Update Your Skill Tracks

### Hero Skills (Attack & Magic)

1. **Fill in Boxes:** For your starting **Attack** and **Magic** experience, fill in that number of boxes on the skill track for each. Always fill in boxes from **left to right**.
2. **Calculate Modifier:** Count all the **+1 symbols** you just covered. This is your **Modifier Value** (or bonus). Write this total value in the box to the left of the track.
3. **Unlock Abilities:** If you covered a box containing a **Circle** icon, you've unlocked an additional **Hero Node** on the Hero Grid. *(You'll select the abilities for this Node in Step 5).*

### General & Trade Skills

1. **Fill in Boxes:** For each **General** and **Trade Skill** listed, fill in the corresponding number of experience (Exp) boxes on their tracks, working from **left to right**.
2. **Calculate Modifier:** Count all the **+1 symbols** you covered. This is your **Modifier Value** (or bonus). Write this total value in the box to the left of the track.
3. **Unlock Perks:** If you covered a box containing a **Star** icon, you've unlocked an associated perk for that skill. *(You'll handle these later in the game).*

## 3. Equip Your Gear

1. **List Items:** Write the name of each **Equipped Item** into its correct slot (Main Hand, Chest, Head, etc.) in the **Equipment** section.
2. **Set Durability:** Each item has a **Durability Value** listed next to it. Find the item's durability circles on your sheet. **Cross out (draw an 'X' over) the circles** starting from the far right until the number of *remaining, unmarked circles* equals the listed Durability Value. This is the item's maximum Durability.

## 4. Fill Your Inventory

1. **List Items:** Write the name of each item listed (Rope, Torches, etc.) into an available slot in your **Inventory** section.
2. **Set Uses (If Applicable):** If an item has a defined number of **Uses** (like limited arrows or potions), find its Use Boxes on your sheet. **Cross out the boxes** starting from the far right until the number of *remaining, unmarked boxes* equals the item's total Uses.

## 5. Unlock Your Starting Abilities (Hero Grid)

1.  **Starting Node:** You automatically have a set of starting abilities. Find the corresponding **Ability Sheet** for your character and follow its instructions to place your **Starting Node** on the Hero Grid.
2.  **Select Additional Node:** Because you covered a **Circle** icon on your Hero Skill track (in Step 2), you get to choose one additional Hero Node. This new Node **must be adjacent** to either:
    * The **center** of the Hero Grid, **OR**
    * Any other **Node you have already unlocked**.
