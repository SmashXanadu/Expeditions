# [Combat](#combat)
When conflict breaks out, the game shifts into **Combat** mode. Combat is organized into rounds, where characters and enemies take turns performing actions.
## [Turn Order](#turn-order)
The **Guide** decides who acts first: the **players** or the **adversaries**. Usually, it's the side that starts the fight.

## [Your Turn (Players)](#heroes-turn)
During your turn, your character can do a few things in any order:
- **Use an Ability** (like an attack or a special move) or **Equip Gear**
- **Move** to a new location
- **Speak** or **Interact** with something

Characters act in order of their **Speed** score, from highest to lowest. If there's a tie in Speed, players decide who goes first among themselves.

### [Using Abilities](#use-an-ability)
When you use an **Ability**, describe what you're trying to do. Make sure your target is within range and line of sight. Roll to resolve the ability if necessary.

### [Attacking](#attacking)
If your Ability is an **Attack** against an enemy:
1. Tell the Guide what you're attacking and with which Ability.
2. The Guide will tell you the **target number** you need to beat. This will be a **Defense** target number for physical attacks or **Resistance** for magic attacks.
3. Roll your D20 and add any relevant bonuses. If your total meets or beats the target number, your attack hits!
4. If you hit, you deal **Damage** as described by your Ability or weapon, and any other effects happen.

Remember you may be able to take a **consequence** to allow your attacks to succeed even on a missed roll, as explained in the "Resolving Dice Rolls" section!
## [Adversary Turns](#enemy-turn)
When an enemy attacks you:
1. The Guide will tell you the enemy's **Attack target number** (for physical attacks) or **Magic target number** (for magic attacks).
2. You roll to **Evade** (for physical attacks) or **Resist** (for magic attacks).
    - If you **succeed**, you avoid the damage.
    - If you **fail**, the Guide tells you how much damage you take.

### [Taking Damage](#taking-damage)
When you take damage:
- You decide how much damage comes from your **Health** and how much comes from your **Equipment Durability**. When taking damage from equipment, describe how that item protected you.
- If your **Health** drops to 0, you fall **Unconscious**.
- If an **Equipment's Durability** drops to 0, that item becomes **Broken**.

### [Zoned Combat](#zoned-combat)
Combat takes place in **Zones**, which are clearly defined areas on a map or table.
- When you **Move** on your turn, you generally move to an **adjacent zone**.
- The **Range** to your targets is also determined by these Zones:
    - **Close**: You are in the same zone as your target.
    - **Near**: Your target is in an adjacent zone.
    - **Far**: Your target is at least one zone away from you.
    - **Distant**: Your target is beyond the current combat area.
