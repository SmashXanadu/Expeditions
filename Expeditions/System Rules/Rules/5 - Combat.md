# [Combat](#combat)
## [Turn Order](#turn-order)
The Guide will determine whether the players or enemies "have the jump". Usually this is whichever side is choosing to initiate combat.

## [Heroes Turn](#heroes-turn)
Each Character acts in order of their **Speed**. The character with the highest Speed goes first, then in descending order. Players decide how to break any ties.

**On your turn you may** (in any order)...
 1. **Use an Ability**, do a **Skill Check**, or **Equip Gear**
 2. **Move**
 3. **Speak** or **Interact** with something in the environment

### [Use an Ability](#use-an-ability)
Read the description of your ability to the group and describe what you are attempting to do. Ensure that you are in range and line of sight of your target(s). Roll to resolve the ability if necessary.

### [Attacking](#attacking)
If you are using an ability to **Attack** an enemy directly...
4. Declare your ability and valid targets
5. Your Guide will tell you the **Defense** or **Resistance** (for Magic attacks) **DC**(s) that you must roll against.
6. Roll! If your roll plus modifiers meets or exceeds the DC, the ability successfully hits.
7. If successful, you deal **Damage** to the enemy according to the ability or weapon used and apply additional effects if applicable.

Remember you can **Stretch** or **Over-Exert** on Attacks!
## [Enemy Turn](#enemy-turn)
If an enemy attacks you…
8. The Guide will tell you the enemy’s **Attack** or **Magic** **DC** (depending on the type of attack).
9. You roll to **Evade** an Attack or **Resist** Magic.
	- If you **Succeed** on the check, you avoid taking damage.
	- If you **Fail** the check, the guide will tell you how much damage to take.

### [Taking Damage](#taking-damage)
- Decide how much damage will be taken from your health and how much will be taken from any specific equipment durability.
	- When taking damage from armor durability, describe how your character takes the brunt of the impact with that equipped item.
- If your health ever reaches 0, you will fall **Unconscious**.	
- If any specific equipment durability ever reaches 0, it will become **Broken**.

### [Zoned Combat](#zoned-combat)
During combat, the play area is broken up into clearly established spaces on a map or table called **Zones**.

Generally, using **Move** on your turn will allow you to move to an adjacent zone.

**Range** to your targets is also dictated by Zones.
- **Close**: In the same zone as target
- **Near**: In adjacent zone to target
- **Far**: At least 1 zone away from target
- **Distant**: Beyond the field of battle
