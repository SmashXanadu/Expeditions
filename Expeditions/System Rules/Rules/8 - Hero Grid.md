# [Hero Grid](#hero-grid)
The Hero Grid represents the advancement of your character as you learn and grow on your adventures. 

You will start with a single node unlocked during the character creation process. Over time you will gain enough experience points on the **Hero Track** to reach certain boxes that will allow you to unlock additional nodes up to a maximum of 5.

When you unlock a node on the Hero Grid, it must be linked to the large central node or linked to a node that you have unlocked already. 

The numbered nodes here represent what a characterâ€™s progression through the grid could look like.

When you unlock a node you immediately gain access to its corresponding abilities and may prepare them by writing them in your ability list.
