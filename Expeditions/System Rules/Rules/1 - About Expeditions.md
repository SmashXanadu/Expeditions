## What makes it different than other RPGs?

**Real-Time Expeditions**
Run Expeditions that last a predetermined amount of real time (30 or 60min) with quick downtime phases in-between.

**Streamlined Combat Rules**
Simplified math and movement to make combat faster. If you are close, you can melee attack. If you are near, you can ranged attack, and if you are far, move closer!

**Minimal Guide (GM) Prep**
System and handouts designed to require less time for the Guide to prepare. 

**Learn by Failure**
Every failed attack or skill check progresses your character. 

**Classless Specialization Grid**
Build your character exactly how you want without being restricted by a class.

**Equipment Matters**
Damage is mitigated by armor durability and health.

**Player Driven Fate**
Only players roll dice. The Guide never rolls.

**Rules for Every Type of Player**
Player materials are designed for different experience levels (Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master), but everyone plays the same game.
