# About Expeditions
## What is Expeditions?
Expeditions is a Role Playing Game (RPG) system that focuses on maximizing how much fun can be had in a short amount of time by using just enough rules to keep things together. It uses a D20 die and should feel familiar to experienced RPG players while being easier to grasp for new players and kids.

## What makes it different than other RPGs?

**Real-Time Expeditions**
Run Expeditions that last a predetermined amount of real time (30 or 60min) with quick downtime phases in-between.

**Streamlined Combat Rules**
Simplified math and movement to make combat faster. If you are close, you can melee attack. If you are near, you can ranged attack, and if you are far, move closer!

**Minimal Guide (GM) Prep**
System and handouts designed to require less prep time. 

**Learn by Failure**
Every failed attack or skill check progresses your character. 

**Classless Specialization Grid**
Create your character how you see it without having to fit into a pre-determined class or job mold.

**Equipment Matters**
Damage is mitigated by armor durability and health.

**No GM Dice Rolls**
Players decide their fate by rolling to attack, evade, and everything in-between.

**Rules for Every Type of Player**
Different versions of player facing materials tailored to fit different player types while keeping everyone playing the same game. Ex: **Novice** (Kids), **Apprentice** (New RPG Players), **Journeyman** (Standard), and **Master** (Advanced Players)
