# [Flow of the Game](#flow-of-the-game)
The game is split into two main parts: **Expeditions** and **Downtime**.

## [Expeditions](#expedition)
An **Expedition** is a focused adventure with a clear objective. You'll have a limited amount of real-world time, usually 30 or 60 minutes, to complete your goal.

During an Expedition, you will be rolling dice and experiencing the excitement of the game. You might be in **Combat**, a **Social Encounter**, or **Exploring**. Keep an eye on the clock, because it's always ticking!

### [Social and Exploration](#social-and-exploration)
Your Guide will handle these moments by narrating the story, roleplaying as other characters, and telling you when to roll a die.

### [Combat](#combat)
Combat has its own special rules, which are described in the next section.
## [Downtime](#downtime)
In between Expeditions, the game shifts to **Downtime**. During this phase, you can choose from a menu of options to describe what your character does. Downtime is handled in short, "fast-forward" scenes and montages.
