# [Resolving Dice Rolls](#resolving-dice-rolls)
You and your **Guide** will discuss which **Skill** or **Ability** you will be using that is appropriate to attempt your desired action, and provide you a **Difficulty Check (DC)** value between 8 (trivial) and 25 (near impossible).

To succeed in your intended action, you must
1. Roll a D20
2. Add any skill-specific modifier(s)
3. Compare the resulting value to the DC.

  **If your Roll, plus your Modifier(s), is equal to or greater**
  **than the DC, it is a Success.**

**Rolling a 1** (ignoring modifiers) is always a **Failure** with a **Major Complication**.

**Rolling a 20** (ignoring modifiers) is always a Success with a **Major Benefit**.

If your Roll, plus your Modifier, is lower than the DC,
you may still be able to succeed in your attempt…
- **If within 2**, you may **Stretch** to succeed with a **Minor Complication**. 
- **If within 5**, you may **Over-Exert** to succeed with a  **Major Complication**. 
- **If more than 5** away from the DC, you **Fail**.

>**Ash**: “To move the boulder, you will need to roll a 16.”

>**Sam**: “I rolled a 13, but my Strong skill is at +2. So 15 	total. I want to stretch to make sure I succeed.”
>
>**Ash**: “You move the boulder, but in the process it rolls over your feet and destroys your boots.”
