# [Resolving Dice Rolls](#resolving-dice-rolls)
When you try to do something with an uncertain outcome, your **Guide** will set a **target number** for you to beat. This number will be between 8 (easy) and 25 (almost impossible).

To find out if you succeed, follow these steps:
1. Roll a 20-sided die.
2. Add any bonuses from your **Skills** or **Abilities**.
3. Compare the total to the target number.

**Success and Failure**
- **Success**: If your total is **equal to or higher** than the target number, you succeed!
- **Failure**: If your total is **lower** than the target number, you fail.

**Critical Rolls**
- **A roll of 1** (before adding any bonuses) is always a **Failure** with a **Major Complication**.
- **A roll of 20** (before adding any bonuses) is always a **Success** with a **Major Benefit**.

**Pushing Yourself**
If you fail, you can choose to succeed by "pushing" yourself, but this comes with a consequence.
- If you miss the target number by **2 or less**, you can **Stretch** for **Success** with a **Minor Complication**.
- If you miss the target number by **3-5**, you can **Over-Exert** for **Success** with a **Major Complication**.
- If you miss by **more than 5**, you **Fail**.

>**Guide**: "To move the boulder, you need to roll a 16."
>
>**Player**: "I rolled a 13, and my Strong skill adds +2, for a total of 15. That's a fail by 1. I'll push myself to succeed."
>
>**Guide**: "You move the boulder, but in the process, you damage your boots."
