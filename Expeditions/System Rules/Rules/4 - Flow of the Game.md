# [Flow of the Game](#flow-of-the-game)
The game takes place in two primary “modes” of play.

The **Expedition** mode sees you and your allies set out to achieve a specific objective within a limited amount of real-world time. 

Most expeditions will take have a 60-Minute timer, but there will be shorter 30-Minute expeditions and some epic expeditions that may last multiple hours.

During an **Expedition** there may be scenes and situations involving **Combat**, **Social Encounters**, and **Exploration**. This is when you are rolling dice and experiencing the excitement of game play from moment to moment. But remember to keep things moving because the clock is ticking!

In-between Expeditions, the game will switch to a **Downtime** mode where things happen in a series of **Montages** and short **Scenes** in a more “fast-forward” style. You will choose from a menu of options to represent what your character does in-between each Expedition.

The next pages will describe **Combat**, which has its own specific rules that are different from the other types of encounters in an Expedition.

As for those other types of encounters (**Social** and **Exploration**), your Guide will let you know in the moment how to handle these different situations by narrating, role playing as Non-Player Characters (NPCs), and calling for specific Skill Checks.
