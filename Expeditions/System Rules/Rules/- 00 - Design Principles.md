Expeditions is built around fast, collaborative storytelling and tactical decision-making without the overhead found in traditional RPG systems. Every rule supports the pillars of **Speed**, **Choice**, and **Consequences**.

--------------

## Core Design Goals

### 1. Fast, Real-Time Play
- Expeditions should resolve full adventures in **30–60 minutes** of real-world time.  
- Every rule must support rapid turns, simple math, and low table friction.
- **Combat**, **social**, and **exploration** scenes use the same unified resolution mechanic.

### 2. Player-Driven Fate
- **Players roll all dice.** The Guide never rolls.  
- This keeps narrative control in the players’ hands and accelerates gameplay.
- The Guide sets stakes and consequences; players determine outcomes through risk.

### 3. Learn by Failure
- **Failure is progression.** Every failed roll provides tangible experience (EXP).
- This keeps players engaged even when things go wrong.
- Systems reward persistence over perfection.

### 4. Consequences Over Randomness
- The **Complication** mechanic replaces many forms of randomness with *player choice*.
- Players may accept **Minor** or **Major Complications** to turn failure into success.
- This reinforces narrative momentum and promotes improvisational storytelling.

### 5. Minimal GM Prep
- The Guide facilitates, not adjudicates.
- Encounters, loot, and adversaries are **modular and reusable**, designed for plug-and-play prep in minutes.
- Rulebooks and handouts are structured for quick lookup, not deep reading.

### 6. Streamlined Combat
- Combat should resolve within **minutes**, not sessions.  
- Movement uses **Zones** (Close, Near, Far, Distant) instead of grid counting.  
- Players make **Evade** and **Resist** rolls to defend—no Guide attack rolls.  
- Equipment durability, positioning, and ability use form the heart of tactical play.

### 7. Classless Customization
- No predefined archetypes or classes.  
- The **Hero Grid** provides open-ended advancement paths using interconnected **Nodes**.
- Each Node grants access to new abilities, encouraging unique and hybrid builds.

### 8. Equipment Matters
- Gear is as critical as character stats.
- **Durability** is a narrative and mechanical resource: players decide how to absorb damage.  

### 9. Universal Resolution
- Every uncertain action—combat, social, or exploration—uses a **d20 + modifier vs. target number** system.
- Target numbers scale from 8 (Easy) to 25 (Nearly Impossible).
- A unified mechanic simplifies teaching and rules reference.

### 10. Accessibility and Modularity
- Rules are split into **Player** and **Guide** booklets, each concise and cross-referenced.
- The system supports **novice** to **expert** players without tailored rulesets.

## Design Values

| Value | Description |
| :----- | :----------- |
| **Speed** | Real-time expeditions and fast resolution loops. |
| **Choice** | Players actively shape success, failure, and growth. |
| **Transparency** | Target numbers and effects are clear before dice are rolled. |
| **Consistency** | Core rules apply equally across all modes of play. |
| **Modularity** | Add-ons (new nodes, skills, or adversaries) plug into existing systems cleanly. |
| **Narrative Momentum** | Failing forward keeps the story moving, never stalling. |
| **Low Overhead** | Minimal stats, prep, and bookkeeping. Everything visible on a single sheet. |

## Future-Facing Intent
Expeditions v1 establishes a **complete, standalone framework** for fast-paced adventure play.  
Future expansions may include:
- **Zone templates** for exploration and travel.  
- **Faction mechanics** for campaign progression.  
- **Advanced downtime** and settlement systems.  
- **Expanded adversary creation tools** for procedural generation.

All future development will follow the same design pillars: *Speed, Choice, Consequence.*
