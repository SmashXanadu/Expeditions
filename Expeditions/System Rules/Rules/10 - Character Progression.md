# [Character Progression](#character-progression)
Your character grows and gets stronger in two main ways: gaining **Experience (EXP)** and managing your **Equipment**.

## [Gaining Experience](#gaining-experience)
You gain EXP primarily in two ways:
- **Learning by Failure:** Whenever you fail a roll, you gain an EXP point for that skill. You'll mark this on your skill's track.
- **Training:** During **Downtime**, you can choose to train a skill to gain EXP for it.

As you gain EXP, you'll mark off boxes on your character sheet. These boxes give you different rewards:
- **+1**: This increases your skill's **Modifier**, making you better at using that skill.
- **Star**: This lets you gain a permanent enhancement for that skill.
- **Circle**: This lets you unlock a new **Node** on the **Hero Grid** and learn the four abilities associated with it.

## [Managing Equipment](#managing-equipment)
Your character has a set number of slots for **Weapons** and **Armor**.

- **Weapons** and **Armor** have durability, and some may have penalties to your speed  based on the armor type (**Light**, **Medium**, or **Heavy**). They can also have magical properties.
- Your **Inventory** can hold up to 10 unequipped items.
- **Gold** is the currency you use to buy and sell items.
