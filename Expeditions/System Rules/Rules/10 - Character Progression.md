# [Character Progression](#character-progression)
Characters will progress primarily in two ways:
**Gaining Experience** (EXP) and **Managing Equipment**

## [Gaining Experience](#gaining-experience)
**Learn by Failure**: Whenever you fail a roll you gain an experience point. Check off the left most unchecked box on the corresponding skill track to represent this.

**Train**: During Downtime you will also have the opportunity to gain experience points for specific skills.

If the box you check has a “**+1**” in it, add one to the skill’s modifier. 

If the box you check has a **star icon** in it, you can select and check an enhancement box on your skill card.

If the box you check is on the **Hero Track** and it has a circle in it, you get to…
1. Select a new **Node** on the **Hero Grid**
2. Learn the associated **4 Abilities**

## [Managing Equipment](#managing-equipment)

**Equipment**: Characters have a set number of slots to equip **Armor** and **Weapons**.
- **Armor** Durability and Speed Penalties will vary based on the armor type (**Light**, **Medium**, or **Heavy**).
- **Weapons** will be either held with 1 or 2 hands and will also have duribility and speed penalties. Both Armor and Weapons may have additional magical properties!

 **Inventory**: Hold up to 10 non-equipped items.
 
 **Gold**: Represents the amount of gold you are carrying.
