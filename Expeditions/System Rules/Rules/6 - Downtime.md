# [Downtime](#downtime)
In between **Expeditions**, the game shifts into a "fast-forward" style of play called **Downtime**. During this time, you and your **Guide** will quickly go over what your character does to prepare for the next adventure.

During each Downtime phase, every player performs the **Standard Activities** and can choose up to two **Optional Activities**.

## [Standard Downtime Activities](#standard-downtime-activities)
- **Rest**: Fully restore your **Health** and all **Ability Charges**.
- **Prepare**: Change your **Skills**, **Equipment**, and **Items**.

## [Optional Downtime Activities (Choose 2)](#optional-downtime-activities)
- **Repair**: Attempt to repair damaged equipment.
- **Train**: Choose a skill and describe how you improve it. Gain 1 **EXP**.
- **Craft**: Use a trade skill to create or modify items.
- **Gather Information**: Mingle with locals and listen for rumors to learn about the area.
- **Research**: Study a specific topic to learn as much as possible.
- **Work**: Take on a job to earn gold.
- **Custom** (Limit 1): Work with your **Guide** to create a unique activity for your character.
