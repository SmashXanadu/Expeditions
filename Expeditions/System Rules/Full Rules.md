# Expeditions
## What is Expeditions?
Expeditions is a Role Playing Game (RPG) system that focuses on maximizing how much fun can be had in a short amount of time by using just enough rules to keep things together. It uses a D20 die and should feel familiar to experienced RPG players while being easier to grasp for new players and kids.

## What makes it different than other RPGs?

**Real-Time Expeditions**
Run Expeditions that last a predetermined amount of real time (30 or 60min) with quick downtime phases in-between.

**Streamlined Combat Rules**
Simplified math and movement to make combat faster. If you are close, you can melee attack. If you are near, you can ranged attack, and if you are far, move closer!

**Minimal Guide (GM) Prep**
System and handouts designed to require less prep time. 

**Learn by Failure**
Every failed attack or skill check progresses your character. 

**Classless Specialization Grid**
Create your character how you see it without having to fit into a pre-determined class or job mold.

**Equipment Matters**
Damage is mitigated by armor durability and health.

**No GM Dice Rolls**
Players decide their fate by rolling to attack, evade, and everything in-between.

**Rules for Every Type of Player**
Different versions of player facing materials tailored to fit different player types while keeping everyone playing the same game. Ex: **Novice** (Kids), **Apprentice** (New RPG Players), **Journeyman** (Standard), and **Master** (Advanced Players)

# Basic Rules
In order to play Expeditions you will need...
				This Rules Zine
				Pencils and pens
				1 20-Sided Die
				1 or more people to play with

You and a group of friends are about to embark on your first expedition where you will laugh, grow, fight, solve problems and discover secrets together.

As you create a story collaboratively, the **Guide** will describe your environment and the situations you find yourself in. It is your responsibility to state what your character would do, and your **Guide** will either describe what happens...

or

...ask you for a roll to determine what happens.
    

**Sam**: “I want to move this boulder off the road.”

**Ash**: “What skill would do you want to use?”

**Sam**: “I would just try to muscle it out of the way using my Strong skill.”

**Ash**: “Okay, you are exceptionally strong. You move the boulder without much effort at all.”

**or**
	
**Ash**: “This boulder is beyond your capability to move with strength alone.”

**or**
	
**Ash**: “I’m not sure if you are strong enough to lift this, let’s roll to see...”

# Resolving Dice Rolls
You and your **Guide** will discuss which **Skill** or **Ability** you will be using that is appropriate to attempt your desired action, and provide you a **Difficulty Check (DC)** value between 8 (trivial) and 25 (near impossible).

To succeed in your intended action, you must
1. Roll a D20
2. Add any skill-specific modifier(s)
3. Compare the resulting value to the DC.

  **If your Roll, plus your Modifier(s), is equal to or greater**
  **than the DC, it is a Success.**

**Rolling a 1** (ignoring modifiers) is always a **Failure** with a **Major Complication**.

**Rolling a 20** (ignoring modifiers) is always a Success with a **Major Benefit**.

If your Roll, plus your Modifier, is lower than the DC,
you may still be able to succeed in your attempt…
- **If within 2**, you may **Stretch** to succeed with a	**Minor Complication**. 
- **If within 5**, you may **Over-Exert** to succeed with a  **MajorComplication**. 
- **If more than 5** away from the DC, you **Fail**.
      
Ash: “To move the boulder, you will need to roll a 16.” 

Sam: “I rolled a 13, but my Strong skill is at +2. So 15 	total. I want to stretch to make sure I succeed.”

Ash: “You move the boulder, but in the process it rolls over your feet and destroys your boots.”

# Flow of the Game
The game takes place in two primary “modes” of play.

The **Expedition** mode sees you and your allies set out to achieve a specific objective within a limited amount of real-world time. 

Most expeditions will take have a 60-Minute timer, but there will be shorter 30-Minute expeditions and some epic expeditions that may last multiple hours.

During an **Expedition** there may be scenes and situations involving **Combat**, **Social Encounters**, and **Exploration**. This is when you are rolling dice and experiencing the excitement of game play from moment to moment. But remember to keep things moving because the clock is ticking!

In-between Expeditions, the game will switch to a **Downtime** mode where things happen in a series of **Montages** and short **Scenes** in a more “fast-forward” style. You will choose from a menu of options to represent what your character does in-between each Expedition.

The next pages will describe **Combat**, which has its own specific rules that are different from the other types of encounters in an Expedition.

As for those other types of encounters (**Social** and **Exploration**), your Guide will let you know in the moment how to handle these different situations by narrating, role playing as Non-Player Characters (NPCs), and calling for specific Skill Checks.

# Combat
## Turn Order
The Guide will determine whether the players or enemies have the jump. That team goes first.

## Players Turn
Each Character acts in order of their **Speed**. Higher Speed goes first, then in descending order. Players decide how to break ties.

**On your turn you may** (in any order)...
 1. **Use an Ability**, do a **Skill Check**, or **Equip Gear**
 2. **Move**
 3. **Speak** or **Interact** with something in the environment

### Use an Ability
Read the description of your ability to the group and describe what you are attempting to do. Ensure that you are in range and line of sight of your target(s). Roll to resolve the ability if necessary.

### Attacking
If you are using an ability to **Attack** an enemy directly...
1. Declare your ability and valid targets
2. Your Guide will tell you the **Defense** or **Resistance** (for Magic attacks) **DC**(s) that you must roll against.
3. Roll! If your roll plus modifiers meets or exceeds the DC, the ability successfully hits.
4. If successful, you deal **Damage** to the enemy according to the ability or weapon used and apply additional effects if applicable.

Remember you can **Stretch** or **Over-Exert** on Attacks!
## Enemy Turn
If an enemy attacks you…
1. The Guide will tell you the enemy’s **Attack** or **Magic** **DC** (depending on the type of attack).
2. You roll to **Evade** an Attack or **Resist** Magic.
	- If you **Succeed** on the check, you avoid taking damage.
	- If you **Fail** the check, the guide will tell you how much damage to take.

### Taking Damage
- Decide how much damage will be taken from your health and how much will be taken from any specific equipment durability.
- If your health ever reaches 0, you will fall **Unconscious**.	
- If any specific equipment durability ever reaches 0, it will become Broken.

### Zoned Combat
During combat, the play area is broken up into clearly established spaces on a map or table called **Zones**.

Generally, using **Move** on your turn will allow you to move to an adjacent zone.

**Range** to your targets is also dictated by Zones.
- Close: In the same zone as target
- Near: In adjacent zone to target
- Far: At least 1 zone away from target
- Distant: Beyond the field of battle

# Downtime
In-between **Expeditions**, the game switches to a Downtime mode where things happen in a series of montages and short scenes in a more “fast-forward” style.

Each player will perform the **Standard Downtime Activities** and up to 2 **Optional Downtime Activities** during each downtime phase.

## Standard Downtime Activities
- **Rest**: Full Health. Restore all Ability Charges.
- **Prepare**: Swap out Skills, Equipment, and Items

## Optional Downtime Activities (Choose 2)

# Hero Grid
The Hero Grid represents the advancement of your character as you learn and grow on your adventures. 

You will start with a single node unlocked during the character creation process. Over time you will gain enough experience points on the Attack & Magic skill track to reach certain boxes that will allow you to unlock additional nodes up to a maximum of 5.

When you unlock a node on the Hero Grid, it must be linked by to the large central node or linked to a node that you have unlocked already. 

The numbered nodes here represent what a character’s progression through the grid could look like.

When you unlock a node you immediately gain access to its corresponding abilities and may prepare them by writing them in your ability list.

# Player Characters

# Character Progression
Characters will progress primarily in two ways:
**Gaining Experience** (EXP) and **Managing Equipment**

## Gaining Experience (EXP)
**Learn by Failure**: Whenever you fail a roll you gain an experience point. Check off the left most unchecked box on the corresponding skill track to represent this.

If the box you check has a **star icon** in it, you can select and check an enhancement box on your skill card.
