# Expedition: Into the Maw
![The Maw - Dyson Logos](https://dysonlogos.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/with-teeth.jpg)

The "**Great Gnawer**," a subterranean deity revered (and feared) by goblin clans, is furious. The **grinding sound** from the "Giant Stone Teeth" has become chaotic and maddening, driving goblins to frenzy. Desperate shamans warn of doom.

**Quest Hook:** **Sniv**, a trembling goblin, explains his brother, **Grubl** (a powerful shaman), and his crew ventured into the "Giant Stone Teeth" a week ago to "appease the Gnawer" and fix the erratic grinding. None returned. Sniv begs for help, offering his tribe's "most cherished" **Gobloon**.
## 1. The Descent

- **Approach:** Ground trembles from a horrible grinding sound. Wide stairwell leads into the hill. Air is stale and metallic.
- **Environmental Hazards:**
    - **Grinding Floor:** Shifting, grinding sections cause trips or injury.
    - **Jutting Teeth:** Sharp, loose rocks on walls scrape or impale.
    - **Falling Debris:** Constant grinding dislodges rocks and dust.

## 2. The Engine

- **Description:** Small chamber with walls of jagged, tooth-like rock formations. A **massive, worn gear mechanism** rotates in the center, producing the grinding sound.
- **Inhabitants:** Several **goblin engineers** are frantically working on the mechanism. They are a new, mechanically inclined breed.
    - **Klok:** Obsessed with gears, sees machinery's rhythm as order.
    - **Wizg:** Tinkerer, seeks to "fix" the grind for Zrilx's favor.
    - **Snag:** Forced engineer, fears Zrilx's punishment more than explosions.
- **Encounter:** Goblins attack when they notice the party. Fight amidst environmental hazards (Grinding Floor, Jutting Teeth, Falling Debris).
- **Exits:** Imposing stone doors to the right (blocked), stairs descending to the left.

## 3. The Still Pool

- **Description:** Natural, cool, damp cavern. Grinding sound muffled, replaced by dripping water. Shallow pool of clear, dark water reflects faint phosphorescent glow.
- **Inhabitants:** Crude altar in an alcove. A gaunt, desperate **Goblin Shaman**, **Grubl** (from a rival tribe), is shackled nearby, moaning a mournful chant.
    - **Grubl:** Shaman of the "Whispering Stone" tribe. Captured while investigating the unsettling silence. Observes captors, hopes to share dire warnings.
- **Encounter:** Opportunity for roleplay and negotiation. Grubl is a prisoner seeking freedom.
- **Interaction:**
    - Could become an **unlikely ally**, offering barrow layout, tribe strengths, or hidden passages for release.
    - Can provide insight into barrow magic or the grinding.
    - Party must decide whether to trust him and how to free him.

## 4. The Chamber of Whispers

- **Description:** Small, unassuming antechamber. Quiet, faint cool breeze. Smooth, unadorned stone walls.
- **Features:**
    - **Glowing, Crystalline Key:** On a pedestal, visible but encased in a translucent, humming magical barrier.
    - **Faded, Abstract Symbols:** Etched into the floor around the pedestal.
    - **Stone Lever:** Set into the wall.
- **Puzzle Goal:** Deactivate the magical barrier to access the key, which unlocks Zrilx's chambers.
- **Solutions:**
    - **Decipher Symbols (Investigation, Arcana, History):** Learn symbols represent magical/elemental forces for sequence activation.
    - **Analyze Barrier (Arcana, Perception):** Identify magic signature to suggest counter-energy.
    - **Manipulate Lever (Trial & Error, Arcana):** Lever is the release. Correct magical input on symbols (e.g., _Ray of Frost_ for cold) enables the lever to dissipate the barrier.

## 5. The Warlock's Audience

- **Description:** Cavern humming with dark energy. Cold, ash-scented air. Smooth walls with crude, glowing glyphs.
- **Boss:** **Zrilx**, the goblin warlock, on a jagged rock throne. Pale green skin, crimson eyes, gaunt, dark robes. Chanting over a pulsating orb of shadow and flame.
    - **Zrilx:** Former shaman-in-training, made a dark pact with a fiend. Uses granted magic to brutally subjugate goblin clans, claiming influence over the "Great Gnawer" to reinforce his power and instill fear.
- **Minions:** A handful of silent, devoted **elite goblin guards**.
- **Encounter Opportunities:**
    - **The Proposition (Negotiation/Roleplay):** Zrilx might offer passage or boons for tribute or service due to his arrogance.
    - **The Display of Power (Intimidation/Magical Showdown):** Zrilx might unleash powerful magic (summon minor fiend from **Shadow Pools**, animate **Warped Pillars**) to intimidate or prove superiority.
    - **The Ritual Disruption (Subtle Approach/Skill Challenge):** Attempt to subtly disrupt Zrilx's ritual (Stealth, Sleight of Hand, Arcana) to weaken or force his retreat.
    - **Confrontation (Combat):** Zrilx uses dark magic and environmental control (shadowy tentacles, animated pillars). Aims to overwhelm and drive back; will escape through a shadowy portal if significantly damaged.

## Epilogue: Returning to Sniv

After the encounter, the party returns to Sniv to discuss what transpired.

- **The Gobloon's Unveiling:** Sniv carefully unrolls a bundle of finely woven, tightly stretched animal hides or cured monster bladders—a patchwork sphere that collapses with a soft sigh. "This," he whispers, "this is our tribe's greatest secret! The **Gobloon**!"
- **Gnawer's Breath:** From a small, intricately carved pouch, he extracts shimmering fungi containing "Gnawer's Breath"—a rare, combustible gas gathered from hidden fissures.
- **Promise of Flight:** Sniv explains the **Gobloon**, when inflated, allows flight above the world, offering unique perspective. He demonstrates how its woven basket can hold several individuals, believing it reveals the "Gnawer's patterns" or the barrow's true magical "heart."
