# Expedition: Mutiny on the Emerald Dawn


The **Emerald Dawn** is a renowned fast clipper ship, known for carrying valuable cargo and even more valuable passengers across the **Azure Expanse**. Today, however, its smooth voyage has been violently interrupted.

**Hook:**

The party awakens in their shared cabin to the sounds of fighting and shouting. A frantic, soaked Cabin Boy, Finn, bangs on the cabin door. "S-sir/Ma'am! Please! Rork and the crew—they've taken the Captain and the bridge! They're flying the black flag!" Finn begs the party for aid, offering a small, antique Pocket Astrolabe—a family heirloom—as a reward if they can help secure the ship and save the Captain.

## 1. The Lower Deck Barracks

The sound of waves against the hull is mixed with the sharp clang of steel and angry yells coming from above.

- The passage is lined with **closely-packed hammocks** and **locked storage trunks**.
- A **smoky oil lamp** swings wildly, casting jumping shadows.
- A **narrow wooden ladder** leads up to the Main Deck (To Area 2).

**The Locked Storage Trunks**: A number of the party's belongings may be locked in here, depending on character creation.

- **Skill Opportunity**: An attempt to pick a lock or force open a trunk would require a successful roll.

**Encounter**: **Two Grumbling Mutineers** are guarding the bottom of the ladder, loudly arguing over which one gets to keep the Captain's spyglass. They immediately notice and attack the party.

\newpage

## 2. The Main Deck

You emerge onto the open deck, where the sea air immediately hits your face. The ship is caught in a storm and is listing slightly to port, and the main mast sail has been partially cut and is flapping uselessly.

- **Wet, slick wooden deck**. The fighting has smeared blood across the planks.
- **Heavy, coiled ropes** and a **metal winch** are scattered about.
- **Open stairs** lead to the Raised Quarterdeck (To Area 4).
- **A companionway hatch** leads down to the Galley/Cargo Hold (To Area 3).

**Environmental Hazards:**

- **Slick Deck:** Failing to move carefully can result in a trip or slide into the ship's rail.
- **Flapping Sail:** Cuts of torn canvas and broken rope snap violently in the wind, a potential distraction or entanglement.
- **Rolling Ship:** Sudden, heavy swells can knock a character off their feet.

**Encounter**: **Three Mutineers** are attempting to cut the remaining rigging to slow the ship. They abandon their task to attack the party. **(Easy Combat)**. Fight amidst environmental hazards (Slick Deck, Flapping Sail, Rolling Ship).

## 3. The Galley and Cargo Hold

Taking the lower hatch, you descend into the airless, hot galley, which smells of stale fish and burnt grease. A single passage leads into the dark, echoing cargo hold.

- **Messy Galley**: Pots and cutlery are strewn about. **A hot iron branding rod** lies forgotten by the fire pit.
- **Cargo Hold**: Crammed with **wooden crates** and **barreled spirits**. An open hatch door reveals the **sloshing bilge water** below.

**The Branding Rod**: Could be picked up (carefully) and used as an improvised burning weapon.

**Barreled Spirits**: These could be broken open or rolled to spill highly flammable alcohol onto the deck.

**Roleplay Opportunity**: Tucked behind a stack of crates is the **Ship's Cook, "Salt"**, a large, intimidating person who is currently terrified and clutching a frying pan like a shield. They know the mutineers' plan—they intend to seize the ship and sell the passengers/cargo at the Isle of Bones —but will only share the information if the party can convince them they are actually in control of the situation. Salt can also offer a small health-restoring "ship's gruel" (potion).

## 4. The Quarterdeck and Helm

You climb onto the elevated quarterdeck. This area gives a clear view of the whole ship and the ocean.

- **The Ship’s Wheel (Helm)** is firmly gripped by **Bosun Rork**.
- **Captain Elara** is tied to the main mast, visibly beaten, but alive.
- **Two heavily-armored Mutineer Lieutenants** flank the Bosun.

**Bosun Rork**:

- The former first mate, who felt he was more worthy of command.
- A charismatic brute who commands the respect of the crew.
- He holds the **Captain’s Blade**, a prized ceremonial cutlass.

**Encounter Opportunities:**

- **Rork engages the players in conversation as they approach the helm...**
    - "You should have stayed in your beds, passengers. The _Emerald Dawn_ has a new Captain now."
    - He offers the party a spot among his ranks, promising wealth and passage to a tropical paradise, if they leave the Captain to him and depart peacefully on the lifeboats.
    - **Skill Opportunity**: An attempt to use **Persuasion** or **Intimidation** to turn the Mutineer Lieutenants against Rork.
- **If the players accept Rork's offer...**
    - Rork laughs and orders his Lieutenants to toss them overboard—he never intended to keep his word. **Combat begins**.
- **If the players engage Rork in combat...**
    - **Tough Combat**: Rork and his **two Lieutenants** immediately attack.
    - **Rork’s Strategy**: Rork is skilled and fights defensively, using the wheel and mast as cover, issuing loud commands to try and **Disrupt** the party's movement or actions.
    - **Lieutenants' Strategy**: The Lieutenants focus on taking out the biggest threats, using their armor to absorb hits.
    - **If the Captain's Blade is snatched from Rork OR Rork is defeated...** the Lieutenants lose morale and immediately attempt to surrender or escape overboard.

## Epilogue: Securing the Dawn

With Rork and his main conspirators subdued, the party returns to Finn to discuss what transpired.

- **If Captain Elara is saved...**
    - The Captain is grateful and immediately takes command, ordering the remaining loyal crew to set the ship back on course.
- **If Rork is still at large (escaped)**...
    - Captain Elara vows to hunt him down and urges the players to keep their eyes open for any sign of his return or any other remaining loyalists.
- **The Pocket Astrolabe's Function:** Finn gratefully presents the **Pocket Astrolabe**. It's not just an antique; it's a piece of advanced navigation gear that can **Predict Local Weather** with perfect accuracy for the next 48 hours.
- **Promise of Safe Passage:** Captain Elara offers the party **Free, Priority Passage** on the _Emerald Dawn_ for any future voyage they wish to take, guaranteeing them safe passage across the treacherous Azure Expanse.
