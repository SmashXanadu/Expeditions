# EXPEDITIONS: RPG

## What is Expeditions?

Expeditions is a fast-paced, cooperative tabletop RPG system focused on thrilling, time-bound adventures. It features **streamlined combat** where the **players roll all dice**, a **classless specialization** system for total freedom, and scenarios designed for **minimal Guide (GM) preparation**. Perfect for quick sessions and cooperative storytelling.

## What makes Expeditions unique?

* **Real-Time Expeditions:** Play sessions last a predetermined amount of real time.
* **Player Driven Fate:** Only **players** roll the dice; the Guide never rolls.
* **Minimal Guide Prep:** Handouts and systems reduce the Guide's preparation time.
* **Streamlined Combat:** Simplified math and movement (Close, Near, Far, Distant).
* **Learn by Failure:** Every failed attack or skill roll progresses your character.
* **Turn a Failure into Success:** Players can accept a consequence to make a roll succeed.
* **Equipment Matters:** Damage is mitigated by both Health and Armor Durability.

## Playtest Expedition: Rifts on the Shifting Isle

**Players:** 2 - 5
**Time**: 35 Minutes

> The scenario begins immediately after the party retrieves the powerful **Planar Core** from a cultist altar, which instantly shatters reality and opens four unstable planar tears across the island. The players are then pitted against a brutal **30-minute real-time clock** before the island collapses completely, forcing them to survive four randomized planar zones and their specific challenges. Success hinges on navigating these chaotic rifts—which contain obstacles, adversaries, social encounters, or powerful bosses—to escape with the Core back to their ship.

## Playtest Scenario: Rifts on the Shifting Isle

**Players:** 2–5  **Time:** 30–35 Minutes  

> The island is breaking apart. The **Planar Core**—the artifact you just retrieved—has fractured reality into chaos. Four Rifts rip across the Isle, each leaking an alien realm. You have **30 minutes** (real-world time) to fight, survive, and reach your ship before the island collapses.

--------------------

## Scenario Setup

- **Starting Zone:** *The Shattered Altar* (Cobblestone Terrain) 
- **Goal:** Escape the Isle with the **Planar Core** before time runs out. 
- **Timer:** 30 minutes real-world time. Keep it visible. 
- **Zone Sequence:** Roll d20 to determine the next Rift Zone after each encounter. 
- **End Condition:** When all 4 Rifts have been resolved, the final **Escape Zone** unlocks. 

**Guide Setup:**

- Place 5 Terrain Circles (1 Starting Zone + 4 Planar Zones). 
- Players begin in the *Shattered Altar*. 
- The **Guide** tracks the timer and narrates each new Rift when it manifests.
## Guide Notes

- **Time Pressure is Everything.** Use a visible 30-minute timer. Announce 10, 5, and 1-minute marks. 
- **Complications Keep the Clock Moving.** Failure = lost time or damage, never stalling play. 
- **Encounters Are Modular.** Zones can appear in any order; roll or choose based on pacing. 
- **Session End:** Debrief players quickly—ask what they enjoyed and what felt tight or confusing.
