# EXPEDITIONS: RPG

## What is Expeditions?

Expeditions is a fast-paced, cooperative tabletop RPG system focused on thrilling, time-bound adventures. It features **streamlined combat** where the **players roll all dice**, a **classless specialization** system for total freedom, and scenarios designed for **minimal Guide (GM) preparation**. Perfect for quick sessions and cooperative storytelling.

## What makes Expeditions unique?

* **Real-Time Expeditions:** Play sessions last a predetermined amount of real time.
* **Player Driven Fate:** Only **players** roll the dice; the Guide never rolls.
* **Minimal Guide Prep:** Handouts and systems reduce the Guide's preparation time.
* **Streamlined Combat:** Simplified math and movement (Close, Near, Far, Distant).
* **Learn by Failure:** Every failed attack or skill roll progresses your character.
* **Turn a Failure into Success:** Players can accept a consequence to make a roll succeed.
* **Equipment Matters:** Damage is mitigated by both Health and Armor Durability.

## Playtest Expedition: Rifts on the Shifting Isle

**Players:** 2 - 5
**Time**: 35 Minutes

> The scenario begins immediately after the party retrieves the powerful **Planar Core** from a cultist altar, which instantly shatters reality and opens unstable planar tears across the island. The players are then pitted against a brutal **30-minute real-time clock** before the island collapses completely, forcing them to survive four randomized planar zones and their specific challenges. Success hinges on navigating these chaotic rifts—which contain obstacles, adversaries, social encounters, or powerful bosses—to escape with the Core back to their ship.

# EXPEDITIONS: RPG  
## Playtest Scenario: Rifts on the Shifting Isle

**Players:** 2–5  **Time:** 30–35 Minutes  

> The island is breaking apart. The **Planar Core**—the artifact you just retrieved—has fractured reality into chaos. Rifts rip across the Isle, each leaking an alien realm. You have **30 minutes** (real-world time) to fight, survive, and reach your ship before the island collapses.

--------------------

## Scenario Setup

- **Starting Zone:** *The Shattered Altar* (Cobblestone Terrain) 
- **Goal:** Escape the Isle with the **Planar Core** before time runs out. 
- **Timer:** 30 minutes real-world time. Keep it visible. 
- **End Condition:** When all Rifts have been resolved, the final **Escape Zone** unlocks. 

**Guide Setup:**

- Place 5 Terrain Circles in a row
	- 1 Starting sone (Shattered Altar)
	- 3 Random Face Down Planar Rift Zones
	- 1 Ship Escape Zone
- Players begin in the *Shattered Altar*. 
- The **Guide** tracks the timer and narrates each new Rift when it manifests as players move through the zones.
## Guide Notes

- **Time Pressure is Everything.** Use a visible 30-minute timer. Announce 10, 5, and 1-minute marks. 
- **Encounters Are Modular.** Zones can appear in any order and have different challenges based on when they appear
- **Session End:** Debrief players quickly—ask what they enjoyed and what felt tight or confusing.
- **Zone Reveal Procedure:** When players enter a face-down zone...
	1. Flip the Terrain Circle.
	2. Announce the Rift’s appearance using its flavor text.
	3. Apply the appropriate encounter based on whether this is Rift 1, 2, or 3.
	4. Begin the encounter immediately—do not pause the timer.

# Starting Zone: The Shattered Altar
**Terrain:** Ruined Temple / Cracked Stone

## Who You Are and Why You Came Here

- You are a small expedition team sent to investigate the cult’s activities on the island.
- Rumors claimed they had recovered an ancient artifact capable of warping reality.
- Your mission was to stop their ritual and secure the Planar Core before they used it.
- The island has been unstable for weeks, and retrieving the Core is your only chance to prevent a catastrophe.

## What Already Happened

- You fought through the cultists guarding the altar.
- Their ritual was moments from completion when you intervened.
- One of you seized the Planar Core as the chamber destabilized. Who?
## What Is Happening Now

- The altar is collapsing into floating shards and bending light.
- The Core vibrates violently, tugging the holder in random directions.
- Rifts are forming overhead, tearing open slivers of other realms.
- Cracks widen underfoot and the chamber grows more unstable by the second.

## What You See Ahead

- Three Rifts flicker to life, each leading to a different unstable zone.
- The only safe exit is the broken archway leading toward the first zone.
- Your ship lies on the far side of the island and reaching it is the only escape.

## Expedition Start
- The Expedition timer begins the moment you step off the altar.
- Once you leave this zone, the countdown does not stop. You have 30 minutes...
