# Expedition: Rifts on the Shifting Isle

## Scenario Setup

* **Starting Zone:** The **Cobblestone Zone** (Altar Terrain).
* Place player miniatures on the Cobblestone Zone surrounding the altar.
* **Zone Transition:** Once this zone's objective is cleared, it is replaced by the **Wooden Planks Zone** (your escape ship) on the far side of the table.

### Background

* The **Planar Core** is a crystalline artifact rumored to stabilize and maintain inter-planar balance. Its power can unlock interplanar travel, and major factions have offered massive rewards for its retrieval.
* It rests upon an altar on the isolated **Shifting Isle**, guarded by cultists.
* The party has successfully located the Core and subdued the cultists guarding it.

**Guide**: "The cultists are neutralized, and the Core is right there, pulsing with raw, crystalline light. **Which of you picks it up?**"

* The moment a player picks up the Core, the planar balance shatters. Jagged planar tears open, bleeding in hostile environments.
* The island is collapsing due to these unstable tears. You have **30 minutes** (real-world time) to navigate through **four** randomly selected planar zones to reach the ship, which is docked on the far side of the shifting  island.

### Determine the First Zone

- Have the player who picked up the **Planar Core** roll a d20. This roll uses the **Zone Encounter Type (D20)** table to determine both the first Planar Rift environment and the challenge presented to the players

**Guide**: "Your die roll just determined the first zone..."

# 1a. Grass

**Planar Rift Type:** Plane of Growth (Jungle/Magical Flora)

> The original area has been violently overwritten by a riot of alien, phosphorescent vegetation. Giant, broad leaves filter the sunlight into motes of intense color, and the air is thick with cloying, sweet pollen. The ground is perpetually soft and spongy.

\newpage

# 1b. Cave

**Planar Rift Type:** Plane of Earth (Cave/Underground)

### d20 Result of 9-10: **Social/Passive**

* **Interaction:** A small, territorial family of **Deep Gnomes** are frantically trying to collapse the tunnels they live in, believing the Rifts are going to swallow their home.

\newpage

# 2a. Sand

**Planar Rift Type:** Plane of Infinite Dunes (Sand/Desert)

> Scorching, orange-red sand stretches in all directions under a hazy, oppressive sky. The air is thick and dry, and walking is labored as the fine, alien particles cling to everything. The ground is a steep, crumbling dune leading to the next Rift.

### d20 Result of 9-10: **Social/Passive**

* **Interaction:** The party encounters a lone, delirious **Nomad Scholar** who is obsessively mapping the Rifts. He is dehydrated and believes the party's ship is a mirage.
* **Goal:** Secure a vital piece of the Scholar's planar map or get information from him about the stable Rifts, all while keeping him alive.

\newpage

# 2b. Underwater

**Planar Rift Type:** Plane of the Depths (Underwater/Deep Sea)

> The party is instantly submerged in crushing, black, ice-cold water (assuming appropriate gear). Light only comes from faint, alien bioluminescence. The pressure is immense, making precise actions difficult.

### d20 Result of 9-10: **Social/Passive**

* **Interaction:** A group of **Planar Merfolk Scouts** has observed the party and is suspicious of the Core. They communicate telepathically and demand to know the party's intentions.
* **Goal:** Convince the Merfolk that the Core must be removed from the Shifting Isle quickly to prevent further planar chaos.
* **Difficulty:** 15 (at Disadvantage due to the telepathic link)
* **Consequence:** Failure means the Merfolk summon their entire patrol, forcing the party to choose between fighting an overwhelming force or taking a circuitous, **10-minute** route.

### d20 Result of 6-8: **Obstacle/Challenge**

* **Task:** Quickly seal or bypass a section of aggressive, deep-sea flora/alien coral that is rapidly growing over the exit Rift, threatening to close it permanently.

\newpage

# 3a. Dirt

**Planar Rift Type:** Plane of Undeath (Dirt/Mire/Unstable Ground)

> The ground here is not solid earth but a thick, sucking mire of black, soupy mud mixed with shattered fragments of time-lost debris and bleached bones. Every step is a struggle, and the pervasive odor of rot and decay hangs in the damp air.

### d20 Result of 9-10: **Social/Passive**

* **Interaction:** The remains of a **Fallen Paladin**, animated by the necrotic energy, stands guard over a shattered piece of armor. The Paladin is confused but highly aggressive towards anyone carrying a magical artifact.

* **Difficulty:** 14
* **Consequence:** Failure means the Paladin attacks, but the fight ends automatically if the party leaves the zone (losing **5 minutes**).

### d20 Result of 6-8: **Obstacle/Challenge**

\newpage

# 3b. Snow

**Planar Rift Type:** Plane of Ice (Snow/Ice)

> The atmosphere here is a sudden, brutal cold. Jagged, black ice sheets cover the ground, reflecting the pale, sunless sky of an eternal winter plane. A freezing wind howls constantly, reducing the effectiveness of ranged attacks.

### d20 Result of 9-10: **Social/Passive**

* **Interaction:** A group of **Arctic Yeti Tribesmen** are performing a protective ritual around a minor Rift, attempting to seal it with powerful ice magic. They are distracted but will attack if interrupted.
* **Goal:** Sneak past the tribesmen or convince them to let the party cross without breaking their ritual.
* **Difficulty:** 15
* **Consequence:** Failure means the ritual is broken, causing a massive, destabilizing Icequake which forces the party to spend **10 minutes** recovering and losing 2 HP each.

\newpage

# 4a. Magma

**Planar Rift Type:** Plane of Fire (Volcano/Lava)

> The air here is a thick, choking mix of ash and fire. The ground is a treacherous mix of cooling, black basalt and streams of bubbling, flowing magma. Heat haze distorts visibility, making it difficult to target anything at range.

### d20 Result of 9-10: **Social/Passive**

* **Interaction:** A small, trapped **Fire Sprite** is desperately calling for help from the other side of a magma channel. It claims to know a safe path out of the zone.
* **Goal:** Safely rescue the Sprite and gain its aid/information, or leave it to burn and find another route.
* **Difficulty:** 14 (to cross the channel safely)
* **Consequence:** Failure means the player takes 2 points of Fire damage and the Sprite is too terrified to offer any help, forcing the party to lose **5 minutes** finding the Rift.

### d20 Result of 6-8: **Obstacle/Challenge**

* **Task:** The party must cross a bridge of unstable, cooling lava rock while being choked by acrid, sulfurous smoke. Players must resist coughing and panicking.
* **Difficulty:** 15

\newpage

# 4b. Open Water

**Planar Rift Type:** Plane of Water (Open Water/Ocean)

> The party is surrounded by tumultuous, churning open ocean. The waves are impossibly large and erratic, as if multiple tides are fighting each other. The atmosphere is perpetually grey and stormy, and the air is thick with sea spray and salt.

### d20 Result of 9-10: **Social/Passive**

* **Interaction:** A group of **Planar Sailors**, lost from a different era and ship, cling desperately to the Floating Wreckage. They are exhausted, delusional, and believe the party's ship is their only salvation.
* **Goal:** Convince the sailors to hold on to the wreckage, or allow them aboard without risking their delusional panic overwhelming the party's own efforts.
* **Difficulty:** 13
* **Consequence:** Failure means the sailors panic and attempt to seize the Core, leading to a brief non-lethal brawl that costs the party **6 minutes**.

### d20 Result of 6-8: **Obstacle/Challenge**

* **Task:** The party must quickly navigate a short stretch of water infested with constantly forming interplanar whirlpools that threaten to drag the ship (or the party) down.
* **Difficulty:** 14
