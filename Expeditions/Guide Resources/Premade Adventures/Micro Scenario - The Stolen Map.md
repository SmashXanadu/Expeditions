# Micro Scenario: The Stolen Map
**Players:** 1  
**Time:** 8–12 Minutes  
**Terrain Needed:** 3 Circles (Forest Path, Cliffside, Goblin Camp)

> A traveling merchant begs for your help—his map to a hidden treasure has been stolen by a sneaky goblin scout. The goblin fled into the woods, and if you move fast, you might catch him before he disappears into the hills.

----------------------

# Zone 1 — Forest Path Ambush
**Terrain:** Woodland Trail / Fallen Logs  
**Encounter Type:** Hazard (TN 12)

> The forest path is blocked by tangled roots and fallen branches. You hear the goblin crashing through the woods ahead—he has a head start.

**Tangled Trail (Hazard)** (TN 12, Close):

- **Fail:** You fall behind—**the goblin gains 1 zone of distance** _or_ you take **1 damage** (player choice).
- **Success:** You keep pace and stay on the goblin’s trail.
- **Major Benefit (Nat 20 or chosen):** You **gain ground**, reducing the goblin’s lead by 1 zone.
- **Complication Options:** Twisted ankle, snagged gear, loud branch snap, dropped item, etc.

**Goal:** Reach the next zone and stay on the goblin’s trail.

----------------------

# Zone 2 — Cliffside Trouble
**Terrain:** Narrow Ledge / Loose Stones  
**Encounter Type:** Minion (1 enemy)

**Rock-Throwing Goblin**  
_2 HP · 1 DPR · Atk 13 · Mag 10 · Def 12 · Res 12_  
The goblin perches on a ledge, hurling rocks to slow you down.

- **Rock Toss (Atk 13, Near):** Evade 13 or take 1 damage.
- **Dust Kick (Mag 10, Close):** Resist 10 or be **Dazed** (Disadvantage on next roll).

**Goal:** Get past the goblin to reach his camp.

----------------------

# Zone 3 — The Goblin Camp
**Terrain:** Small Firepit / Crude Tents  
**Encounter Type:** Boss

**Goblin Scout Leader**  
_4 HP · 2 DPR · Atk 14 · Mag 12 · Def 13 · Res 13_  
A wiry goblin with the merchant’s stolen treasure map tucked into his belt.

- **Dagger Lunge (Atk 14, Close):** Evade 14 or take 2 damage.
- **Trick Dust (Mag 12, Close):** Resist 12 or take 1 damage and be pushed 1 zone.

**Goal:** Defeat or intimidate the scout to recover the map.

# Endings

## Success
> The goblin yelps and drops the stolen map, scrambling into the bushes. The merchant is overjoyed when you return it—promising you a share of the treasure once he deciphers it.

## Failure
> The scout escapes deeper into the woods, laughing as he disappears with the map. The merchant sighs, thanking you for trying—looks like *that* treasure will stay hidden a little longer.
