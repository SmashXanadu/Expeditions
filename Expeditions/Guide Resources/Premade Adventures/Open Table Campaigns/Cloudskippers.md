## Questions

- What nation are you patrolling?

## Session 0

- You are crew members of a Sky Skimmer, a massive blimp freighter that patrols the nation’s skies for defense.
- The Sky Skimmer discovered a small planar rift in the sky, and they are assembling a crew with varied skills in order to go on an exploratory mission into the rift.
- The crew will be made up of the following core roles and can gain experience for performing them well.
    - [Player Role] Cartographer
    - [Player Role] Biologist
    - [Player Role] Documentarian
    - Captain / Leader
    - Security
    - Mechanic
    - Medic
    - Scientist / Scholar
- Scribe
	- The scribe is the official notetaker for the game with an intention of sharing these notes with other players and the GM. These game notes keep the notetaker engaged in the game (as do the rest of these roles and activities) and also bring solidity to the game overall. Events really feel like they happened when they're captured in notes. These notes also help the GM remember where things are headed and what stuff the players paid attention to. These notes also serve as a lasting record for the whole campaign at the end. Scribes can share their notes in a shared file like a Notion notebook or a Google Doc or email them around to everyone. Even hand-written notes can be sent as images to the group. Ideally every player and the GM should have a copy and keep them together so they can have a full chronicle of the campaign.
- Cartographer
	- Traversing a dungeon and drawing how it connects helps keep the group grounded in the events of the game. It lets players really explore the dungeon, knowing where they've been and what they've missed. Drawing maps helps them discover how the dungeon works. Drawing maps can be tricky, because often the player's version of a map doesn't match the GM's version but that's ok. One need not be an expert cartographer either. A stick and box chart works just fine. Drawing maps isn't as necessary if you're using a virtual tabletop but for in-person games or games where screenshots of rooms are shared, a player-drawn map can help everyone keep the layout of a dungeon in mind.
- Quartermaster
	- Who's keeping track of the loot? Who's telling everyone the split of gold? Where's that all-important magic item again? The quartermaster keeps a full list, maybe even using double-entry bookkeeping to note what loot was picked up and who it was distributed to. Without a quartermaster, stuff gets lost. Even with a quartermaster, players should still keep track of their own loot and inventory – that's the second part of the double-entry bookkeeping. Like the other artifacts of this job, a loot list is best if it's shared with the group. A spreadsheet in Google drive is a great way to share it but even a digital or handwritten list will do. Keep track of the date, the item, and who it went to. Ask the quartermaster to periodically remind everyone of unclaimed loot which their character might want to claim.
- The Caller
	- The caller is a new role for me. The caller's job is to adjudicate choices of a group and give the GM a final determination. They are a facilitator for the group, asking people's opinions, taking votes, working through disagreements, and coming to an answer they can give to the GM. This role, more than the others, requires a player who's able to facilitate choices – keeping in mind the players feelings as well as an in-world understanding of what's happening to the characters in the game. It's worth a conversation with the caller to understand the delicate nature of this skill. It's definitely a people-focused role to take but a powerful one when assigned.

Finding the Damaged Balloon

Looming above a ramshackle wooden pier is a balloon anchored by four thick ropes tied around wooden posts driven deep into the mire. The balloon's bladder expands and sags at irregular intervals as swamp gas fills it briefly before leaking out through various tears in its patchwork fabric. A bullywug stands near the top of a ladders and is using a long silver needle and a spool of catgut to sew up one of the openings. A second bullywug stands at the foot of the ladder to steady it. Huddled nearby are three giant frogs whose long tongues snap up passing insects.

Swamp Gas Balloon. This vehicle is operational, albeit damaged. The balloon itself has 10 hit points remaining (out of a maximum of 15), and the bullywugs are in the midst of repairing it. The basket and the ropes that attach it to the balloon are intact and undamaged. For more information on Downfall's balloons, see the "Swamp Gas Balloons" sidebar.

### Swamp Gas Balloons

p76

A swamp gas balloon has two separate parts:

- The wicker basket, which can carry up to 750 pounds, is a Large object with AC 11, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
- The balloon, which contains the swamp gas that provides lift, is a Huge object with AC 11, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the balloon drops to 0 hit points, it bursts, and the vehicle loses the ability to fly.

To rise into the air, the balloon must be filled with swamp gas. A flap at the bottom of the balloon lets the gas in, and the balloon takes 10 minutes to fill when empty. Once filled, the balloon rises into the air. One can force the balloon to land by using an action to open a flap at the top of the balloon, which allows the swamp gas to escape. To reach this flap, one must climb or fly to the top of the balloon, 20 feet above the basket. The balloon's rigging makes such a climb possible.

The vehicle has no form of propulsion, instead relying on the pilot's ability to navigate air currents.

As long as the balloon or basket has at least 1 hit point, it can be repaired. Repairing 1 hit point of damage to either part of the vehicle requires 1 day and the necessary supplies.
